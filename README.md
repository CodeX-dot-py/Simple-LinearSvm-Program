# Simple-LinearSvm-Program

It is just a binary classifier which works for separating only two class.

# How to use:

## creating a model:
 
 model = linearSVM()

## train the data:
 
 model.fit(X, y) (X should be of two dimension)

## predict the data:
 
 model.predict(x) (The diamention of x must be 2)
